# Guess the Number
This is a simple Python program that generates a random number between 1 and 100 and prompts the user to guess the number. The program provides feedback to the user if their guess is too low or too high, and ends the game when the user correctly guesses the number or runs out of attempts.

# Getting Started
To run this program, you will need Python 3 installed on your computer. You can download Python from the official website.

Once you have installed Python, you can download the program code by cloning this repository:

```bash
    https://github.com/henricvivian/guess-the-name.git
```
Then, navigate to the program directory:
```bash
    cd guess-the-number
```
And run the program:
```bash
    python guessthenumber.py
```

# How to Play
- The program will generate a random number between 1 and 100.
- You will be prompted to guess the number.
- If your guess is too low, the program will tell you "Too low!".
- If your guess is too high, the program will tell you "Too high!".
- Keep guessing until you correctly guess the number or run out of attempts.
- If you correctly guess the number, the program will tell you how many attempts it took you.
- If you run out of attempts, the program will end and tell you the secret number.
